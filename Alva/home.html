        Digital Death is currently a website made to allow you into the strange and peculiar mind of it's creator, Alva. All his life he's considered himself to have a penchant towards all things design and aesthetic related, and he's made a habit of drawing things since the first day he was able to pick up a pencil. With the help of this website he aims to showcase the things he has created and will continue to create.

             Lately he has been broadening his skillset and is amazed by the world-changing oppurtunities this digital world we've created and live in every day gives us. His primary aim in particular is to create an independent video game studio by the name of DIGITAL DEATH. For now this website will serve as a placeholder, but the intent is for it to be iterated upon as his plans fall into place.

            Alva strongly feels that the new cannot exist without the old. A solid foundation of classical design principles is necessary in order to create digital media that speaks to the soul. In his belief computers have made people quite lazy, and despite the amazing potential current technology allows for it has mostly contributed to a deluge of uninspired mediocrity. Soulful human talent is quite literally dying a digital death one could say.
